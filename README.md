# Improved ERC404 - Integrated with ERC5169 and TokenScript
The Improved ERC404 is based on [ERC404 V2](https://github.com/Pandora-Labs-Org/erc404), [ERC5169](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5169an) and [TokenScript](https://github.com/SmartTokenLabs/TokenScript). By incorporating ERC5169 and TokenScript into the ERC404 tokens as the token frontend, we facilitate a safer and more convenient operation for users. This integration not only secures and streamlines trading but also substantially enhances liquidity.
# Features
- Standardized Token Frontend: Utilizing TokenScript to provide an HTML-like frontend framework for tokens, standardizing token display and interaction.
- Secure Frontend-Backend Connection: Ensuring a secure and convenient connection between the token frontend and smart contract backend via the ERC5169 standard.
- Enhanced Interoperability: Supporting the development of highly interoperable applications, enabling tokens to be seamlessly used across various apps and platforms.
- User-Centric Design
# Getting Started

## Installation

# Example Usage
This specific ERC404 improvement will give token holders greater visibility and control over ERC-20 and ERC-721 token transfers.
It will also enable advanced use cases beyond collectibles, such as ERC404 memberships and ERC404 accounts.
